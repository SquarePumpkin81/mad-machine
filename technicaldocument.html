        <p>If you are a gamer, this is a list of video games that you need to play before you die.</p>
        <p>The list ranges provides (from my experience) some of the best video games you could ever experience from single player to couch co-op with friends or a life partner.</p>
      </article>

  <section class="main-section" id="Single_Player">
    <header>Single Player</header>
      <p>There are simply too many single player experiences to list here but if we had to start with a series, it would include the likes of Red Dead Redemption & of course, The Last of Us.</p>
      <p> Rockstar and Naughty Dog brough some of the heaviest hitters to gaming consoles and PC's the world has ever seen or experienced. </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>Red Dead Redemption Series (Playstation, Xbox, PC)</code></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><code>The Last of Us Series (Playstation, PC)</code></li>
        </ul>
      <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>Metal Gear Solid (PS1)</code></li>
        </ul>

      <p>It's no secret that Nintendo reigns supreme in party games and couch co-op. Some of the best experiences and more memorable ones I've had with playing with my kids and family are the games you will see below.</p>
      <p>Of course there are many more but these games below set the bar extremely high.</p>    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Please seek counseling before, during, and after Overcooked.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>Overcooked 1 & 2 (Nintendo Switch)</code></li>
            <li><code>Pikmin 3 (Nintendo Gamecube, Switch)</code></li>
            <li><code>Luigi's Mansion 3 (Nintendo Switch)</code></li>
          </ul>

    <header>Multiplayer</header>
      <p>It is my belief that Xbox took some of the largest leaps in online gaming as this list primarily consists of mostly Microsoft/Xbox Titles</p>
        <code>
          <ul>
            <li><code>Left 4 Dead 1 & 2 (Xbox 360)</code></li>
            <li><code>Halo 3 (Xbox 360)</code></li>
            <li><code>Halo Combat Evolved (Xbox)</code></li>
            <li><code>Minecraft (Xbox, Playstation, PC)</code></li>
            <li><code>Call of Duty Series (Xbox, Playstation, PC)</code></li>
          </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Platformers">
    <header>Platformers</header>
      <p>In this list, I will include 3D platformers alongside some of the orginal 2D titles.</p>
      <p>As time and technology has progressed, platformers seem to have lost their way but served at one point, the peak of gaming in it's era but even over the years, they can take us back to reminisce during our youth when they were once popular. </p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>Super Mario Sunshine (Nintendo Gamecube)</code></li>
            <li><code>Super Mario Bros. (NES)</code>
            <li><code>Super Mario 64 (N64)</code></li>
            <li><code>Donkey Kong Country 1 & 2 (SNES)</code></li>
          </ul>
