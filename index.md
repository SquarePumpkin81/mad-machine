      <ul>
        <li>Metallica began recording their sixth studio album.</li>
        <li>The album was recorded at The Plant in Sausalito, California and was released on June 4, 1996.
        </li>
        <li>Load has a much more mid-paced, groovier sound that verged on hard rock as opposed to thrash.</li>
        <li>At 79 minutes, Load is Metallica's longest studio album.</li>
        <li>The album's lyrical themes show a striking departure from Metallica's previously social and politically charged subjects; many of Load's tracks discuss themes of depression, including "Bleeding Me", "Mama Said", and "Until It Sleeps", all of which are about the death of Hetfield's mother, and "The Outlaw Torn", which is said to be about the band coping with Cliff Burton's death. Other songs, such as "The House Jack Built" and "Cure", discuss themes of drug and alcohol addiction, and "Thorn Within" and "Poor Twisted Me" reflect James's struggles with depression. </li>
        <li>Ulrich adopted a minimalist approach to his drum recording, abandoning the speed and complex double bass drumming patterns of previous albums, and using simpler techniques and playing styles. </li>
        <li>Hetfield also felt that the change to Eâ™­ was a bonus, as it was easier to perform string bends in the riffs.[16]</li>
