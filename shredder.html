          I was born in Columbus, Ohio. I have lived here most of my life except
          for when I had briefly served in the U.S. Military. I am a husband and
          father of 2 young boys.
          <br />
          <br />
          My wife and I met back in late 2014 just around Christmas when we met
          mutually through friends at Lazer Kraze in Lewis Center, Ohio. Not
          much longer after we met, I proposed to her on our trip to myrtle
          beach. After some apartment living for awhile, we got married in June
          of 2018 and purchased our first home in Canal Winchester and welcomed
          our first son into the world, Wyatt Fuller.
          <br />
          <br />My first job doing something somewhat techy, I was working at AT&T
          where I would troubleshoot user phone issues, setting up new devices,
          and addressing billing issues.
          <br />
          <br />That's when I realized I could do something in the tech space, I
          decided to look for full-time work while I was pursuing my degree and
          somehow fell into a full-time IT role on the service desk at Safelite
          Autoglass.
          <br />
          <br /> 
          <p class = "article-text2">After some time, I became their marketing and promotions manager for
          match presentation. Some notable achievements for me in this role was

          <br />I finished up my degree while working full-time and unsure of
          whether or not I was going to land a role in sports, I decided to
          pursue my masters. Midway through that program, I was hired by the
          Columbus Crew as their IT manager.
          <br />
          <br />After my stint in marketing, nights and weekends were no longer
          my ideal lifestyle so I chose to pursue balance. Shortly after leaving
          the crew, our 2nd son was born into the world. Welcome to the world
          Theodore Ray Fuller.
